# Car Rental System

## Overview

The Car Rental System is designed to manage the rental process for cars. The system targets two types of users: **Admin** and **Customer**. Admin users can add and update car information, handle bookings, and send booking confirmations. Customers need to register before making bookings and can also check their booking history. The system is developed using object-oriented programming principles to ensure clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
